"""
submission/bm25.py — Okapi BM25 ranking.

Required component (assignment Section 4.1): "a BM25 implementation with
tunable k1 and b." See the assignment background (Section 3) for the
Robertson & Walker / Robertson & Zaragoza references this is based on.

BM25 score for a query Q = q1...qn against document D:

    score(D, Q) = sum_i  IDF(qi) * ( tf(qi, D) * (k1 + 1) )
                                   / ( tf(qi, D) + k1 * (1 - b + b * |D| / avgdl) )

A standard IDF variant (Robertson-Sparck Jones, +1-smoothed so it stays
non-negative even for terms occurring in more than half the corpus):

    IDF(qi) = ln( (N - df(qi) + 0.5) / (df(qi) + 0.5) + 1 )

where:
    N        = number of documents in the corpus
    df(qi)   = number of documents containing qi
    tf(qi,D) = term frequency of qi in D
    |D|      = length of D in tokens
    avgdl    = average document length across the corpus

k1 (typically 1.2-2.0) controls term-frequency saturation; b (in [0, 1])
controls document-length normalisation strength. Both must be exposed as
parameters, not hard-coded — you need to sweep them for your report
(assignment Section 8, "parameter search procedure for k1, b").
